This Backend-Project includes a CRUD and a Login-System. After logging in, when you click on Home in the navbar, you will see all animals, when you click on Seniors there are only pets older than 8 years. When you click on the Available-Pets Button you will see the result. Below there is a link to the admin panel, it's only possible for admins. If you click on "Take me home" you will get more details about the pet. Click on Adopt, then the pet will land in the petadoption-table in the db. You will see all adopted animals after clicking "Adopt". In the admin_panel you can edit or delete the pet. You can log in and log out in the navbar or get to the dashboard (or user-home) if you are logged in, where you can edit and delete users. From there you can also get to the admin_panel. If you are Admin, the link to the dashboard will appear instead of Login.
